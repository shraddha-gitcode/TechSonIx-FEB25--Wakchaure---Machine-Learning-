# TechSonIx-FEB25--Wakchaure---Machine-Learning-
Handwritten Digit Recognition Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
1. Introduction
This project is a machine learning-based solution for recognizing handwritten digits using a specialized type of neural network called a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The primary objective is to demonstrate how neural networks can effectively handle and classify image data.

The model is built and trained using the MNIST dataset, a benchmark dataset widely used in the field of deep learning for image recognition tasks. This dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9), each with a size of 28x28 pixels.

This project includes:

A complete workflow for training and evaluating a CNN model.

Scripts to preprocess the data, train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions on new data.

Visualization of the model's learning progress through accuracy graphs.

4. Detailed Project Workflow
This project follows a systematic approach to achieve the task of handwritten digit recognition. Below is a detailed explanation of each step:

Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Loading the MNIST Dataset:

The dataset includes 60,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing. Each image is labeled with its corresponding digit (0–9).

Normalization:

To enhance the model's learning efficiency, the pixel values are scaled to a range of [0, 1].

Reshaping:

The 2D images are reshaped to include a single color channel, making their shape (28, 28, 1).

Step 2: Building the CNN Model
The CNN is built using TensorFlow and Keras with the following layers:

Convolutional Layers: Extract important patterns such as curves and edges from the image.

Pooling Layers: Reduce the size of the image data, keeping the essential features intact.

Flatten Layer: Flattens the 2D image matrix into a 1D array for input into the fully connected layers.

Dense Layers: Fully connected layers for making predictions. The last dense layer uses a softmax activation function to output probabilities for each digit (0–9).

Step 3: Model Training
The model is trained on the MNIST training dataset over multiple epochs (iterations through the entire dataset).

During training, the model adjusts its weights to minimize error and improve accuracy.

Step 4: Model Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated on the MNIST test dataset (10,000 images) to check how well it generalizes to new data.

Step 5: Visualizing Results
Training Accuracy: Tracks how well the model is learning from the training data over time.

Validation Accuracy: Tracks how well the model performs on unseen data after each epoch.

The graphs help identify issues like overfitting and assess the overall training progress.

5. Results and Observations
Test Accuracy: The model achieves a test accuracy of ~99%, meaning it correctly classifies 99 out of every 100 images.

Visualization: Plots of training and validation accuracy show consistent improvement, confirming effective learning.

6. Technologies and Tools Used
The project leverages cutting-edge technologies and tools to deliver high performance:

Programming Language: Python 3.7+

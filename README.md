Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Introduction

This is a project I worked on to classify handwritten digits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The main objective was to train a deep learning model capable of recognizing digits (0–9) with high accuracy, based on the popular MNIST dataset.


The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images, each 28x28 pixels in size. It is commonly used as a benchmark for image recognition models. In this project, I applied my skills in data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation to achieve excellent performance in digit recognition.


This project showcases not only how CNNs work but also how to implement them using frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras. It is designed to be a complete and user-friendly learning experience for anyone curious about machine learning and image classification.

How My Project Works


1. Data Preprocessing
I started by loading the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image was normalized (scaled to values between 0 and 1) and reshaped to match the CNN's input requirements (28x28x1).


3. Building the CNN Model
   
The CNN consists of the following layers:


Convolutional Layers: Extract key patterns like edges and textures.


Pooling Layers: Reduce the dimensionality of the image data while retaining important features.


Flatten Layer: Converts the 2D image data into a 1D array.


Dense Layers: Fully connected layers that make the final classification.


3. Training the Model

   
I trained the CNN using the MNIST training dataset over five epochs, where the model learned to associate images with their corresponding digit labels. I used the Adam optimizer for efficient weight adjustments and sparse categorical cross-entropy for the loss function.


5. Evaluating Performance
After training, the model's accuracy was evaluated on the test dataset containing 10,000 images. The final test accuracy was ~99%, indicating the model's strong generalization ability to new, unseen data.


7. Visualizing Results

To monitor the learning process, I plotted the training and validation accuracy over epochs. The graphs demonstrated consistent improvement, highlighting the model's effective learning.

Results and Observations


Accuracy: The model achieved a test accuracy of ~99%, showcasing excellent performance in digit classification.


Visualization: Accuracy graphs showed the model's steady progress, with training and validation accuracy closely aligned—indicating minimal overfitting.

Challenges and Future Enhancements

Challenges I Faced

Handling ambiguous or poorly written digits was sometimes challenging.


Balancing training and validation accuracy to avoid overfitting.


Future Improvements


Data Augmentation: Adding techniques like rotating or distorting images to make the model more robust.


Advanced Architectures: Exploring models like ResNet or Inception for potentially better performance.


Character Recognition: Extending the project to recognize letters or other symbols.


Web Application: Developing a simple app to demonstrate real-time digit recognition using the model.
